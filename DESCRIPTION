Title: Access the What3Words API
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Barry Rowlingson <b.rowlingson@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: The What3Words API encodes location with three
    words. Encoding in the opposite direction is also
    implemented, from three words to location. Full
    details on http://what3words.com where you will also
    have to get an API key. Note that this encoding is
    proprietary, and a patent has been applied for. You
    will be at the mercy of the company if you choose
    to use this for anything serious.
